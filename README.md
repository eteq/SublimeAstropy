Sublime Astropy
---------------

This repository contains some tools I've written to make it easier to code in
the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) style using 
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

Installing/Using
----------------
To use this, just clone this repository into your sublime text ``Packages``
directory (with the default name ``SublimeAstropy``).  You may also want to 
add a "path" entry in the ``astropyTest.sublime-build`` file pointing to the
directory indicating which python interpreter is the right one.  That should 
be all you need to do!
