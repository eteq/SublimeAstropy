Sublime Astropy
---------------

This repository contains some tools I've written to make it easier to code in
the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) style using 
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

Installing/Using
----------------
To use this, just clone this repository into your sublime text ``Packages``
directory (with the default name ``SublimeAstropy``).  You may also probably 
need to edit the "path" and "working_dir" entries in the 
``astropyTest.sublime-build`` file pointing to point to the python 
interpreter's directory and the path to the astropy source.
